To set up the database, you'll need a supabase instance.  Use the prod.sql and the schema-v1.0.0-to-1.2.0.sql files to set up the table structure, then import the full export csv files.  you'll also need a storage bucket called permit-documents and you'll need to set the access policy so everyone can read/write to that.  Out of the box, there's no RLS, so you'll need to keep your anon (or public) key fairly safe unless you implement authentication and RLS.
